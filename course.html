    <h4>About us</h4>

    <p>The university emblem was designed by Sri Kowta Rammohan Sastri with the guidance of Cattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy. The rising sun represents the university itself and the radiating light rays representing its faculties of study. The lotus is the seat of Goddess Lakshmi (prosperity) and Saraswati (knowledge). The swastika is the symbol of benediction. An ocean is the vast region of knowledge. The two serpents represent the seekers and custodians of wisdom.[7]</p>
